# Developer's Notes:

## What I learnt:
I found this project extremely challenging. I learnt a great deal about context API, and general state management principles, and how to use these to update the UI. I also used React-Bootstrap for the first time, which saved a lot of time on styling. 

Much of the firebase.js file was taken from online video tutorials, as my skills with full-stack/backend are not as strong as with frontend. But in the process, I gained a much better grasp of user authentication, async operations, noSQL databases, and how all of these can interact with a react application’s context/state variables. 

## What I’d change:
If I could make any improvements, I would add a mock card-payment facility (eg Stripe) as this would make it a more saleable product. I’d also take a bit more time making it mobile-friendly: whilst Bootstrap helped with this, I imagine React Native (which I’ve yet to explore) would make it even better. 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
